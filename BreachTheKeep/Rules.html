			<h1>Rules</h1>

<h2>Objective:</h2>

<p>
To work your way down the board passing through Gates, taking your opponents pieces and occupying and breaching Keeps with the ultimate aim of breaching your opponents’ home Keep OR taking enough of your opponents’ pieces that they are unable to breach your home Keep.
</p><h2>
The Board:
</h2><p>
The board consists of 56 Hexagons, 10 Squares and 13 Octagons; these are laid out in rows:
</p><p>
* The Hexagons represent normal moving spaces in which any piece can move/take/combine pieces.
</p><p>
* The Squares represent Gates that can be passed through, BUT NOT stopped on, and these do not deduct from the movement number assigned to each piece.
</p><p>
* The Octagons represent Keeps that can be held and breached in accordance with the breaching rules (see below) – The single Octagon at your end of the board represents your home keep, both you and your opponent have a home keep. If you successfully breach your opponents’ keep you win the game.
</p><h2>
Setting Up:
</h2><p>
* Each player has 14 pieces that start in their end zone; this is the blank space between your home keep and the end of the board.
</p><p>
* The players then decide the value of their home keep between one and six. The higher the number the harder the game will be and probably the faster it will be.
</p><p>
* White moves first, to start the game each player must move pieces out of their end zone in accordance with the movement rules (see ‘Holding and Breaching a Keep’ below).
</p><p>
* There is no limit to how many pieces you may choose to leave in your end zone, nor is there any point in the game when you can be forced to move them out unless no other movement is possible.
</p><p>
* With white leading the game play alternate between black and white.
</p><h2>
Movement:
</h2><p>
* Each single piece is worth two points and, once moved, must move two spaces.
</p><p>
* It is possible to ‘double’ a piece; to do this a player must be able to move one of their pieces directly onto a square containing another of their pieces. The pieces are then stacked on top of each other and the move count and number of points the piece is worth is doubled to four.
</p><p>
* Each player is allowed a total of four moves per turn. You MUST use all four moves. This can be done in two ways, either: Move two single pieces two spaces each OR Move one double piece four spaces
</p><p>
* Pieces CANNOT be combined to make doubles before they have been moved onto the board.
</p><p>
* To create a double a single piece does not have to have moved the full two spaces it is assigned for your turn, it may only move one to land on the other piece. HOWEVER doubling counts for the full two moves that that piece is allowed and you cannot move the double piece you have just created on that turn as it requires four moves and you will only have two remaining.
</p><p>
* A double piece can be split later in the game at which point each one (or just one) of the stacked pieces moves its standard two from the space that the double is on.
</p><p>
* If you have moved two and all the rest of your pieces are doubles a double MUST be split to complete the required four moves.
</p><p>
* You CANNOT move over, or stop on a space that the piece you are moving has already been on or over that turn.
</p><p>
* You CANNOT move through or over another piece regardless of whether it is friend or foe.
</p><p>
* Moving into a Keep forfeits the rest of that pieces moves (see “Holding and Breaching a Keep below).
</p><p>
* You CANNOT move through a Keep in one go – you must move through the Gate OR into the keep on one turn and out of the Keep on your following turn.
</p><p>
* You CANNOT move through a Gate if the Keeps both sides of the gate are occupied by your opponent.
</p><p>
* You also CANNOT move through a Gate if the Keep one side of the Gate is occupied by your opponent and the other occupied by yourself. No one can move through this gate until one of the Keeps is unoccupied or the opposite Keep is breached so both sides of the Gate are held by one player, then they can move through the gate and the other team may not.
</p><p>
* If both Keeps on either side of a Gate are unoccupied, either player may move his pieces through this Gate.
</p><h2>
Taking a Piece:
</h2><p>
* To take a piece you move onto the same space as it and remove it from the board. The piece that did that taking then remains in that space and any remaining moves it had are forfeit and CANNOT be passed to another piece.
</p><p>
* A double piece can take single or double pieces however a single piece can only take other single pieces and not doubles.
</p><p>
* Pieces in keeps cannot be taken unless the keep is breached (See ‘Holding and Breaching a Keep’).
</p><p>
* Any piece removed from the board either through taking or breaching is removed permanently from the board and may not renter the game.
</p><h2>
Holding and Breaching a Keep:
</h2><p>
* To take a Keep you need only move one of your pieces into an unoccupied Keep (at which point the rest of that pieces moves – if any – are forfeit and it cannot be moved out the Keep until the next turn).
</p><p>
* You may move up to a maximum of three pieces into a Keep – these can be single pieces or doubles – so the maximum number of points held in a Keep can be twelve in the form of three double pieces.
</p><p>
* Pieces can be combined inside a Keep – so if a Keep is held by three pieces two that are doubles and one that is a single you can move another single in to create a double with the single piece already inside.
</p><p>
* If you hold the Keeps either side of a gate you opponents pieces may not move through that Gate.
</p><p>
* You may not move into a Keep that is occupied by your opponent unless you breach the Keep.
</p><p>
* To breach a Keep you must have the relevant number of points represented in any combination of pieces on adjacent spaces to the keep you are planning to breach. The amount of points you need is relevant to the amount of point they hold inside the Keep: 
</p>
<h3>REMEMBER A SINGLE PIECE IS WORTH TWO POINTS A DOUBLE IS WORTH FOUR!</h3>

<p>* Once a Keep is breached all pieces within are removed from the board and the pieces breaching may move into the Keep – up to the maximum of three pieces and twelve points any excess pieces must stay where they are. </p>
<h2>Winning the Game:</h2>
<p>There are two conditions on which you can win the game:</p>
<p>1. You breach you opponent’s home Keep using the standard breach rules in accordance with the amount of points you set your home Keep to be worth at the beginning of the game. </p>
<p>2. You take enough of your opponent’s pieces from them not to have enough to breach your home Keep – for example if you set the breach value to four points at the beginning of the game and your opponents falls below four points (four single pieces or two double piece or one double and two singles) you win. </p>
